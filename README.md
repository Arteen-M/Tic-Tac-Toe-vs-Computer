# Tic-Tac-Toe-vs-Computer
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play vs a computer
The computer follows a simple strategy:
1. If the Computer can Win, play that move
2. If the Player threatens to Win next turn, block it
3. If the Center is empty, take it
4. If the Player controls a Corner, play the opposite Corner
5. If a Corner is empty, play that Corner
6. If an Edge is empty, play that Edge

It's a simple strategy, but is unbeatable (you will always at least tie)
